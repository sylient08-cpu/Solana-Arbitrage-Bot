# Solana Arbitrage Bot

## Overview
A high-performance Solana arbitrage bot for Solana that monitors price differences across multiple DEXes and executes profitable trades automatically [contact me](https://t.me/av1080trading). This bot supports multiple DEX types including PumpSwap, Raydium (AMM, CLMM, CPMM), Orca Whirlpool, and Meteora (DLMM, Pools), providing comprehensive coverage of the Solana DeFi ecosystem.
The bot leverages real-time transaction monitoring through Yellowstone gRPC to identify arbitrage opportunities across various DEX protocols.

## Features

- **Multi-DEX Support** – Monitors price differences across 7+ major Solana DEXes including PumpSwap, Raydium, Orca, and Meteora
- **Real-time Monitoring** – Uses Yellowstone gRPC for ultra-low latency transaction monitoring and price discovery
- **Automated Arbitrage** – Automatically detects and executes profitable arbitrage opportunities across DEXes
- **Advanced Pool Discovery** – Intelligent pool discovery and caching system for efficient price monitoring
- **MEV Protection** – Optional Jito integration for MEV protection and transaction bundling
- **Configurable Parameters** – Customizable arbitrage thresholds, slippage tolerance, and liquidity requirements
- **Transaction Logging** – Comprehensive logging and recording of all trading activities
- **Cross-platform Build** – Supports both Windows and Linux builds with optimized performance

```

# Usage

## Running the Bot

```bash
# Development mode
cargo run

# Release mode with optimizations
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release
```

## Build for Production

### Linux/Ubuntu
```bash
make build
```

### Cross-compile for Windows (from Linux)
```bash
make install  # Install prerequisites
make build-x86_64  # Build for 64-bit Windows
make build-i686    # Build for 32-bit Windows
```

### Using the build script
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

## PM2 Process Management

```bash
# Start with PM2
make pm2

# Stop the bot
make stop

# View logs
pm2 logs
```

# Architecture

The bot is structured into several key modules:

- **`engine/`** - Core arbitrage logic, monitoring, and swap execution
- **`dex/`** - DEX registry and integration modules
- **`services/`** - External service integrations (Jito, Nozomi, ZeroSlot)
- **`core/`** - Token handling and transaction utilities
- **`record/`** - Transaction logging and data persistence
- **`common/`** - Shared configuration and utilities
